new plan!

we are not going to use any real time messageing whatsoever BEFORE the webrtc connection is established!

we are going to have a lobby!
the lobby lists all the games which are available
how do we know which games are available?
when we start to host a game or search for a game we POST our ICE candidates and connections thingys
we put that all into the datastore
meanwhile we are also polling and checking the datastore for others who are doing the same thing

when we want to connect to someones game we already know his ICE and other thingys
...so i can connect to someone at which point i can send him data, but he cant send me data :(
but i can send him the data that indicated that I connected...then he gets my ICE candidates via http now

So i can build this in memory at first!
Then use datastore in case 2 instances come up!



....but CRAP!

this repo is a fucking mess!
we'll need to add yarn workspaces so we can have a package.json for game and one for server
then that lets us copy the package.json for server into dist for app engine to install with
...along with a /static directory which is the output of game webpack build
...just dont depend on anything linked so workspaces wont confuse GAE
