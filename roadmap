theme the lobby
    - epic lobby music(think pubg)

lobby map
    - when someone joins we plot the location on a map(this might actually be useful since its p2p! you cant connect to a dude in brazil!)

devrig
    - ability to spin up a single player game with no need to use the lobby (its far too slow for development)
    - ability to use websockets on the development server to connect the lobby(again its too fucking slow)


ability to view stats of the dude whos challenging me (add a /stats thing with wins/losses)

Multiplayer game
    -ability to move a tank using the connection
        - basic impl only sends clicks(and will be prone to desync and differing outcomes)
        - next impl needs to be doing "only i say when i die or am hit"

publish the gcloud express wrapper thing to npm
    - can probably make it generic so you can dynamically send any kind
    - that kinda needs to be optional though
    - makes config more like app.use('/data', models({
        projectId: 'foo',
        kinds: ['kind1', 'kind2']
        // or
        kinds: [{ 
            kind: 'kind1',
            ttl: 1000
        }]
        // or omit kinds and dynamic kinds is default..use a regex or something
    }
