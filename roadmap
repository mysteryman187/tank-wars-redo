theme the lobby
    - challenge dialog(make a morse code sound effect when you get one)
    - challenge declined msg (toast not dialog also which has morse code sound)
    - epic lobby music(think pubg)
    - ability to change user name
    - do something with the map/right space
    - better text than "enlist here"

loading screen
    - could look better or have somethign going on

lobby map
    - when someone joins we plot the location on a map(this might actually be useful since its p2p! you cant connect to a dude in brazil!)

devrig
    - ability to use websockets on the development server to connect the lobby(its too fucking slow)(wontfix high effort)

ability to view stats of the dude whos challenging me (add a /stats thing with wins/losses)

Multiplayer game
        - basic impl only sends clicks(and will be prone to desync and differing outcomes) - done
        - next impl needs to be doing "only i say when i die or am hit"
        - we also need to send our location..prety much constantly (probably in the update lok but debounced?)
        - also send out actions and targets(thats a real bug just now - we rely 100% on AI doing same things based on actions)

publish the gcloud express wrapper thing to npm
    - can probably make it generic so you can dynamically send any kind
    - that kinda needs to be optional though
    - makes config more like app.use('/data', models({
        projectId: 'foo',
        kinds: ['kind1', 'kind2']
        // or
        kinds: [{ 
            kind: 'kind1',
            ttl: 1000
        }]
        // or omit kinds and dynamic kinds is default..use a regex or something
    }

gameplay
    - we really need buildings/scenery, now that we can scroll about its very easy to get lost in blankness
    - fix camera on startup so that its centred on a tank, also add some tweened arrow which disapears to indicate where to go

bugs
 - tank wont retarget after killing current target(actually it does seem to)
 - tanks colliding is a super basic impl and is shit and they get stuck all the time
 - german tank turret offset is wonky when facing chassis left
 - turn server wont always work - we could have a fallback relay? (but we need websockets for that)


Mobile
    - add to home screen
    - offline/asset caches?
