new plan!

we are not going to use any real time messageing whatsoever BEFORE the webrtc connection is established!

we are going to have a lobby!
the lobby lists all the games which are available
how do we know which games are available?
when we start to host a game or search for a game we POST our ICE candidates and connections thingys
we put that all into the datastore
meanwhile we are also polling and checking the datastore for others who are doing the same thing

when we want to connect to someones game we already know his ICE and other thingys
...so i can connect to someone at which point i can send him data, but he cant send me data :(
but i can send him the data that indicated that I connected...then he gets my ICE candidates via http now

So i can build this in memory at first!
Then use datastore in case 2 instances come up!

since all we want to do is establish a mesh in the lobby
we could probably just use a listbox to list stuff out at first

do we really want to make a mesh in the lobby?

pros:
it means we wont ever fail to connect to someones game - if they show uo we already made a conncection
I could have a text chat feature in the lobby really easily
I get to build a mesh & chat before I try to tackle the game - will have most of the code we need to get going multiplayer this way

cons:
it doesnt seem too scalable - but this wont really be an issue unless we had hundreds of concurrent users
no chat feature possibility
if we really want to see everyone i.e. a proper and scalable solution
    - it would be to use the polling mechanism to list out the games(was the original plan)
